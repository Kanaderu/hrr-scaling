-just finished changing find all parents to work new get_key_from_vector scheme
-TODO: fix all the get_key_from_vectyor and related fns so they work properly.

10:48 pm
-so i think I've got all those functions straightened out. should be good to run tomorrow

-things are working, at least for the neural jump test
-also, suddently started giving the times it used to (~ 43s / jump)...no idea why. maybe some other process was running before?

12:38 pm
-hierarchical test not working in the non-neural case...not getting any of the positive tests and not printing out the traversal use non-hrr.

-hierarchical test not working in the neural case...parameters on the neurons may not be correct.
-notice that there are two different threshold funcs, one in gpu_cleanup.py, one in neural_associative_memory....two different thresholds too, should mesh these together.

-i've been adding tests to the test folder for the last couple of days...using a python lib called networkx for creating graphs to test on.

apr 25 2013 5:18 pm,
-the problem was I wasn't using enough neurons in the cleanup! had to use 20 in each ensemble
-this is really important, and is actually confirmed by the results connor got

-I'm going to start the unidirectional neural jump tests...only "", "-u" and "-iu
-here I just want to record the official word on how the network decides on success on the jump test:

*************
Basically, I want to say its a success if the similarity between the returned vector and the correct semantic
pointer is greater than test_threshold = 0.8 and is greater than the similarity with any incorrect result.

So in the case of associators that return vectors, the "correct" stat will be the one I concern myself with,
all the others will be false since they only really apply in the case where multiple answers are returned
*************

-added a class to test assoc_memory_tester specifically, separate classes for the vector and non-vector case (both should use the assoc_memory rather than neural_assoc_memory for speed purposes). specifically want to test testLink since its such a complicated function
