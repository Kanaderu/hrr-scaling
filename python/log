-just finished changing find all parents to work new get_key_from_vector scheme
-TODO: fix all the get_key_from_vectyor and related fns so they work properly.

-so i think I've got all those functions straightened out. should be good to run tomorrow

-things are working, at least for the neural jump test
-also, suddently started giving the times it used to (~ 43s / jump)...no idea why. maybe some other process was running before?

-hierarchical test not working in the non-neural case...not getting any of the positive tests and not printing out the traversal use non-hrr.

-hierarchical test not working in the neural case...parameters on the neurons may not be correct.
-notice that there are two different threshold funcs, one in gpu_cleanup.py, one in neural_associative_memory....two different thresholds too, should mesh these together.

-i've been adding tests to the test folder for the last couple of days...using a python lib called networkx for creating graphs to test on.
